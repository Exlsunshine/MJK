# MJK
This is a part of an Android based App which is used to monitor people's health condition.<br>
Again, it's only part of the app, the code is not completed.

P.S<br>
This repository is used only for cloud back up.<br>
I <b>highly not recommend</b> anyone to read these codes, because the previous team member wrote messy codes and I don't want to refactor it...<br>

I don't involved into this project at first...<br>
After I read the previous team members' codes... <br>
I am strongly not interested to get invoved into this project...<br>
